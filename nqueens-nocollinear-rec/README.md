# nqueens-nocollinear-rec

The single file is a `direct` approach, the project is easier to understand and has some tests.

## single file use

```
java NQueensNoCollinear.java boardSize
```

boardSize has to be small (varies on hw)

## java artifact (after build)

```
java -jar build/libs/nqueens-nocollinear-rec.jar boardSize
```

## output

Each line is a solution array encoded by position starting at 0

Example:

`2 0 3 1 -> solution tuple ((1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2))`
